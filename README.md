# Transparent Government Procurement System

A blockchain-based platform for fair, accountable, and efficient public procurement processes.

## Overview

This decentralized system transforms government procurement by leveraging blockchain technology to create transparent, tamper-proof records of the entire procurement lifecycle. The platform enhances public trust through immutable audit trails, reduces corruption through automated enforcement of procurement rules, and increases competition by lowering barriers to participation for qualified vendors.

## Core Components

### Vendor Registration Contract
- Validates qualified government suppliers through secure identity verification

- Implements automated debarment checks against prohibited vendor lists
- Creates immutable history of vendor performance across multiple contracts
- Enables secure management of sensitive corporate information

### Bid Submission Contract
- Securely records and seals proposal details until official opening time
- Implements cryptographic techniques to prevent premature bid exposure
- Ensures bid integrity through tamper-evident storage of all submissions
- Maintains comprehensive audit trails of submission timing and modifications
- Automates receipt confirmation to bidders with cryptographic proof

### Evaluation Contract
- Applies objective criteria to select winning bids through programmable scoring
- Records detailed justifications for all evaluation decisions
- Implements conflict of interest checks for evaluation committee members
